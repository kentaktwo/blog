I attended a wedding reception of a member of my band at Osaka.

Our band had a performance there, which was exciting and I belive we did well.
Actually I had gotten my thumb burned last week and I still had a blister at that time, but fortunately it didn't affect my play because the stick didn't hit the blister.

Having said that, an injury at a thumb makes me inconvenient in doing anything, and I can't go bouldering until it heals. I feel I get injuries whenever going bouldering become a habit.

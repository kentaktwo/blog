To improve my English skill, I decided to try "journaling".
Journaling is introduced as a method to improve English speaking skill by writing journals in English and memorizing phrases in them.
Journaling helps me increase my vocabularies and prepare for using phrases in English conversations.

So I opened this blog and I'd like to try writing journals as often as possible.
The primal purpose of this blog is to improve my English skill rather than express my thoughts.

I'd really appreciate it if you could correct any mistakes and teach me better/useful phrases in English conversation.
